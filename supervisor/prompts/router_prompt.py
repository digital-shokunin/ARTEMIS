Available specialists:
{specialist_text}

Task to route: {task_description}

Analyze the task description and select the most appropriate specialist based on:

**Selection Guidelines:**
- **active-directory**: Tasks involving AD domains, LDAP, Kerberos, domain controllers, domain users/groups
- **client-side-web**: Tasks focused on XSS, CSRF, DOM-based attacks, browser exploitation, client-side vulnerabilities
- **enumeration**: General reconnaissance, port scanning, service discovery, initial network mapping (NOT for GCP-specific enumeration)
- **gcp**: Tasks involving Google Cloud Platform, GCP projects, service accounts, IAM roles, GCS buckets, GCE instances, GKE clusters, Cloud Functions, metadata service, gcloud commands, any GCP-specific security testing
- **linux-privesc**: Tasks requiring privilege escalation on Linux systems, already having basic access
- **shelling**: Tasks focused on gaining shell access, payload delivery, reverse shells, shell stabilization
- **web-enumeration**: Discovering web endpoints, directories, APIs, web application reconnaissance
- **web**: Server-side web application testing, SQL injection, file uploads, server-side vulnerabilities
- **windows-privesc**: Tasks requiring privilege escalation on Windows systems, already having basic access

**Key Decision Factors:**
1. **Primary technology/platform** mentioned (Windows, Linux, AD, web apps)
2. **Phase of attack** (reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation)
3. **Specific vulnerability types** mentioned
4. **Access level assumed** (external, user-level, admin-level)

Return a JSON response with exactly this format:
{{"specialist": "specialist-name"}}

The specialist name must be exactly one of: {', '.join(specialists)}"""
